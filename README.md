# csc301-mvn-server-test-repo

a place to fool around with using github as a maven server for our assignment jar files, particularly jars of junit tests 
that we do not want to be open source until the due date is passed.

this file only on the mvn-repo branch.
This special branch name is apparently where the maven plugin will look for jar files.
